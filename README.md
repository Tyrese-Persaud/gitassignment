# Purpose of Repository
The repository was created to demonstrate how to collaborate on GitHub using branches, commits, and pull requests. It shows how two users can work together on the same project, review each otherâ€™s changes, and merge updates into the main branch.
# Steps
Step 1. Install Git on my computer and create a GitHub account.

Step 2. Created a new public repository on GitHub and named it gitassignment.


Step 3. Invited my collaborator through the repository and Confirmed they accepted the invitation


Step 4. Copied the repository URL and cloned it to my local computer using Git Bash.

Step 5. Created a new branch named feature-branch to separate my work from the main branch. Added files such as the README.md and added python file print("Tyrese Persaud") I used commands like (git add.) ( git commit -m "Add initial print") and (git push to push new changes to branch) to upload changes.

Step 6. Committed and pushed the changes to GitHub.


Step 7. Opened a Pull Request in GitHub, opened a Pull Request to merge the feature-branch into the main branch and added my collaborator to review.


Step 8. The collaborator reviewed the pull request and approved it.


Step 9. Merged the Pull Request into the main branch.


Step 10. Verified changes and documentation checked the repository to ensure the updated files appeared on the main branch.Updated the README.md file with a clear description, steps  and both collaborator names.

Step 10. Captured proof for submission took a screenshot showing the repository, usernames, and the approved pull request. Uploaded the final PDF submission to Moodle.
